Welcome to my page!

I am a PhD Candidate in the [Statistics and Data Science department](https://statistics.ucla.edu/) at University of California, Los Angeles, co-advised by Professors [Hongjing Lu](https://cvl.psych.ucla.edu/) and [Ying Nian Wu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~ywu/). Prior to this, I obtained my M.S. in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering department (Machine Learning and Data Science)](https://ece.ucsd.edu/) at University of California, San Diego, advised by Professor [Pamela Cosman](https://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/faculty/profile?id=28) for my thesis as well as Professor [Sheng Xu](https://xugroup.eng.ucsd.edu/) for further applied research.
